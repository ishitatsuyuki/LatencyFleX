# LatencyFleX (LFX)

Vendor agnostic latency reduction middleware. An alternative to NVIDIA Reflex.

![LatencyFleX brings competitive advantage with up to 10ms latency reduction](performance.png)

## Why LatencyFleX?

To get an idea why queuing happens in video games and why it causes increased latency, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CKnJ5ujL_Q).

To learn more about LatencyFleX's internals, check out [the blog post](https://ishitatsuyuki.github.io/post/latencyflex/).

## Limitations

- LatencyFleX current does not provide any benefits when VSync is enabled.  
  This is blocked on [presentation timing](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/pull/1364) support.
- LatencyFleX introduces jitter in frame time as a part of its algorithm, which results in microstutters.  
  Though, most games tend to have a larger frame time fluctuation already, so this is likely unperceivable.

## Known issues

- Minor stutters might happen.

  **Tip:** If you are using AMD GPUs, try modifying the power profile to reduce power management induced stutters: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1500#note_1228253
- GPU utilization will be lower (around 95% when GPU bound).
- It might take one second or two to adapt to large frame rate increases (e.g. if the game sets a background frame limit).

## Building from source

See [docs/BUILDING.md](./docs/BUILDING.md)

## Usage

For now, LatencyFleX can be used on Linux through one of the following injection method. Game engine integration is planned.

### Running games with LatencyFleX

**Warning:** Be careful when using LatencyFleX with games having anti-cheat:

- Direct hooking (UE4 hook) can trip the game's integrity check and directly get you banned.
- Proton NVAPI integration is relatively safe, but I am not responsible for any bans issued due to LatencyFleX.

Please do it at your own risk.

Tested games:

|--------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Apex Legends [^1]        | ✅       | Proton NVAPI   |
| Titanfall 2 w/ Northstar | ✅       | Proton ([Native](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/installing-northstar/steamdeck-and-linux/installing-on-steamdeck-and-linux#latencyflex))|
| Overwatch [^1]           | ✅       | Proton NVAPI   |

| Ghostrunner              | ✅       | Proton NVAPI   |
| God of War               | ✅       | Proton NVAPI   |
| Spider-Man Remastered    | ✅       | Proton NVAPI   |

[^1]: Uses anti-cheat. Use at your own risk.
[^3]: Game was previously supported with manual UE4 Linux hook. This is no longer possible in an easy way as the game does not ship with symbols now.

#### Proton NVAPI (for games that already have NVIDIA Reflex integration)

1. [Install](#installation) the Vulkan layer, wine extension and DXVK-NVAPI with LFX support.
2. Put the following in `dxvk.conf` [^2]. If you haven't created one, create it next to the game executable.
   If there are multiple executables, try copying and putting `dxvk.conf` next to every executable.
   ```ini
   dxgi.nvapiHack = False
   dxgi.customVendorId = 10de # If running on non-NVIDIA GPU
   ```

3. Launch with the following environment variables:
   ```shell
   PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 DXVK_NVAPI_DRIVER_VERSION=49729 DXVK_NVAPI_ALLOW_OTHER_DRIVERS=1 LFX=1 %command%
   ```
4. Don't forget to enable **Reflex Low-Latency** in-game.

Not working? See [troubleshooting guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

[^2]: A previous version of this document claimed that this is DX11 only. This is not true and it's required for DX12 too
as they use DXVK's DXGI implementation.

#### UE4 Hook

Supported platforms: Linux (see note)

**Note:** for now, the UE4 hook only supports Linux UE4 builds with PIE disabled.

1. [Install](#installation) the Vulkan layer.

2. Obtain an offset to `FEngineLoop::Tick`. If the game ships with debug symbols, the
   offset can be obtained with the command:
   ```shell
   readelf -Ws PortalWars/Binaries/Linux/PortalWars-Linux-Shipping.debug | c++filt | grep FEngineLoop::Tick
   ```
   Find the line corresponding to the actual function (other entries are for types used in the function and unrelated):
   ```
   268: 00000000026698e0  9876 FUNC    LOCAL  HIDDEN    15 FEngineLoop::Tick()
   ```
   Here `26698e0` is the offset we need. We will call it `<OFFSET>` below.
3. Modify the launch command-line as follows.
   ```shell
   LFX=1 LFX_UE4_HOOK=0x<OFFSET> %command%
   ```

#### Unity Mod/Hook

Supported platforms: Proton, Linux

1. [Install](#installation) the Vulkan layer. Also install the Wine extension if the game runs on Wine/Proton.
2. Install [BepInEx Bleeding Edge](https://docs.bepinex.dev/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) to the game directory.
3. Run the game once to generate BepInEx directory structure, config files and startup log.
   Obtain the Unity version from the first line of `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`.
4. Drop `unity/<RUNTIME>-<VERSION>/LatencyFleX.dll` (from [release artifacts](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX/releases))
   into `BepInEx/plugins`. `<RUNTIME>` is `mono` or `il2cpp`. `<VERSION>` is:
   - `2018.1` for any version higher or equal to 2018.1 (This is currently unsupported for IL2CPP)
   - `2019.3` for any version higher or equal to 2019.3
   - Older versions (5.x, 4.x) are unsupported.
6. Use the following launch command-line.
   ```shell
   LFX=1 %command% -force-vulkan # for native
   WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" LFX=1 %command% # for Proton
   ```

## Installation

### LatencyFleX Vulkan layer (essential)

For Debian-like distros, copy the following files from [release artifacts](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX/releases) to your root filesystem.

```
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblatencyflex_layer.so
/usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/latencyflex.json
```

For Arch-like distros, you need to copy `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblatencyflex_layer.so -> /usr/lib/liblatencyflex_layer.so`
and additionally update the path specified in `/usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/latencyflex.json`.

### LatencyFleX Wine extensions (required for Proton Reflex integration)

**Note:** The Wine extensions are migrated to a new Wine API in this version. Wine 7.0 or later is recommended, older versions might be unsupported.

1. Copy the following files from [release artifacts](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX/releases) to your Wine installation location.

   For Wine 7.x: change `/usr/lib/wine` to wherever Wine/Proton is installed.
   For Proton and certain distros, you also need to change `lib` to `lib64`. Copy the following files.
   
   ```
   /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/latencyflex_layer.so
   /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/latencyflex_layer.dll
   /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/latencyflex_wine.dll
   ```

   For Wine <= 6.x: copy the files as follows.
   
   ```
   /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/latencyflex_layer.dll.so -> lib/wine/latencyflex_layer.so
   /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/latencyflex_layer.dll -> lib/wine/fakedlls/latencyflex_layer.dll
   /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/latencyflex_wine.dll -> lib/wine/fakedlls/latencyflex_wine.dll
   ```
2. Create symbolic links to `latencyflex_layer.dll` and `latencyflex_wine.dll`, inside `drive_c/windows/system32/` under your prefix.

   (Alternatively, copy these files. The drawback is that you need to copy these files on every LFX update.)

   Proton prefixes can be found under `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/<appid>/pfx`.

### DXVK-NVAPI with LatencyFleX integration (required for Proton Reflex integration)

Obtain binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases). Minimum version with LatencyFlex integration is 0.5.3.

For Proton, copy `nvapi64.dll` into `dist/lib64/wine/nvapi`.

For other Wine installations, see [DXVK-NVAPI documentation](https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi#how-to-use).

### MangoHud with metric support (optional)

Obtain binaries from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/MangoHud/actions?query=branch%3Acustom-metrics)
and install it to your system.

Put the following line in `MangoHud.conf` to have real-time latency metrics:

```
graphs=custom_Latency
```
